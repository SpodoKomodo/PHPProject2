        <h3>A short list of a few places around the world I've been to:</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>France</h2>
        <img src='France.jpg'>
        <p>Every year for as long as I can remember my parents have saved up their holidays for the summer time when me and my sister would be off too, and we would go to France.
           It was like a family ritual, the drive to the boat, the slow crossing, the trek across France, living out of a mobile for a few weeks.
           We've been to a lot of places over the years, but the main place was 'Dormaine des Ormes' in the east.
           I actually find Paris somewhat of a place to avoid in France, as a complete tourist trap with exorbitant prices for everything from accomodation to dinner, no space and no beach.
           Smaller, coastal campsites with plenty of interesting local countryside and culture to discover always seemed the better option from my own travels.
           Between the food, weather, coastline and childhood memories, France has quietly become one of my favourite places on earth.

        <h2>Egypt</h2>

        <p>During December 2011 I spent a week in Egypt with my family in the resort town of Sharm El Sheikh, on the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula.
           A whopping 4500 miles away from Cork, everything is vastly different there, from the scorching hot weather, to the curving horizon of sand dunes, to the culture and societal norms exhibited there.
           At the time quite a dangerous country for a spot of tourism, we were rarely ever allowed to be left unattended in Sharm El Sheikh, taken to an enclosed resort immediately via shuttle bus, with high walls and a policy of only leaving via pre arranged vehicular transport, due to the dangers of being a comparatively wealthy tourist on their own at the the time.
           We did however have one day where we were shuttled out to the city proper in a huge bus and told we had 2 hours to explore before our rendezvous with the bus again, and it completely opened my eyes to the reality of the place.
           What I had hyped up in my mind's eye to be some sort of war torn, broken down city was actually a bustling hive of activity and culture.In fact one local vendor spoke enough Irish to convince us to buy some of his wares, which I found rather impressive.
           
        <h2>Germany</h2>
        <img src='Germany.jpg'>
        <p>Out of everywhere I've ever travelled to, Germany is certainly the one which subverted expectations the most.
        Usually on holidays you imagine that you know what you are getting yourself into, in Spain you have siestas, in France you have wine, in Poland you have vodka and in Russia you have snow.
        With Germany, I imagined I'd find efficient public transport and beer, possibly some sausages.
        What I found, was heat. Incredible heat. We're talking like 40° Celsius during the day and 30°C at night. Even the flies died in the heat.
        You were pool bound for 85% of the day with the heat, which luckily made me stick to exploring the local area and the village of Herbolzeim, with it's incredible classical architecture and friendly community on full display.
        The only real "attraction" I experienced was the Black Forest, an incredible vista which stretched out before us and contained hike trails over 300km in length..</p>
